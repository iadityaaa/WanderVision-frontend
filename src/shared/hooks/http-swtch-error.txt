New type pf error handling : What if our req is on its way and during that only our user switches the page.



*If you switch to a different page while an asynchronous request is still in progress, 
it won't necessarily result in an error. However, it can lead to unexpected behavior or "race conditions" if not handled properly.


*Here's what typically happens when you switch pages while an asynchronous request is ongoing:
1.The component unmounts: When you switch to a different page, the current component unmounts. 
->This means that any ongoing asynchronous operations inside the component, such as the fetch request in your case, may be canceled or left unresolved.
2.Potential memory leaks: If the asynchronous operation continues running even after the component unmounts, it can cause memory leaks or attempts to update the state of an unmounted component. 
This can lead to errors and unexpected behavior.


*To avoid these issues, you can follow some best practices:
Cancel ongoing requests: Use an appropriate cleanup mechanism to cancel ongoing requests when the component unmounts. 
For example, you can use the AbortController API in combination with the signal option of the fetch request to cancel the request when the component unmounts.
